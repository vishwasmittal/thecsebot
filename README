###Bot Features
This is the main area of contribution. Here is the core code running to 
ensure the correct response of the bot.


##Setup
1. Create a new virtualenv by typing the command:
    
        $ virtualenv -p python3 <sample-env-name>

2. Activate that virtualenv by executing:

        #make sure you are inside your virtualenv directory that is created in prev step then execute
        $ source bin/activate 
    
3. Install the *requirements* by using the command in terminal:

        (myenv)$ pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Create a *.env* file in the root of the project and obtain the api-keys 
listed in *sample_dotenv* file and copy them in *.env*

5. Run Django server. to check if everything is runing smooth, using the command:

        (myenv)$ python manage.py runserver

Now you are ready to add some awesome features in this bot!
